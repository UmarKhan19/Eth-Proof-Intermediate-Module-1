# Error Handling in Solidity - Module1

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates error handling techniques using the `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements. Let's explore how error handling is implemented in the code!

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Solidity compiler version 0.8.7 or compatible
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code from the provided source.
2. Open the Solidity code file named `Module1.sol` in your preferred development environment.

## Error Handling

The `Module1` contract showcases error handling mechanisms through the use of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements in the `divide` function.

### `divide(uint256 a, uint256 b)`

This function takes two unsigned integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the division operation as an unsigned integer.

The error handling process in the `divide` function is as follows:

1. The `require` statement is used to check if the divisor (`b`) is not zero. If `b` is zero, the execution is immediately halted, and an exception with the error message "Divisor cannot be zero" is thrown. This ensures that the division operation is performed only when the divisor is non-zero, preventing a potential division-by-zero error.

2. After the division operation, the `assert` statement verifies that the result is greater than or equal to 10. If the result is less than 10, the execution is halted, and an exception is thrown. This assertion ensures that the division result meets a specific condition and catches any unexpected behavior that might violate the contract's logic.

3. Additionally, an `if` statement is used to check if the result exceeds 100. If this condition is met, the `revert` statement is triggered, causing the transaction to be reverted with the error message "Result exceeds limit". This ensures that the division result is within an acceptable range and prevents undesirable outcomes.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function successfully completes and returns the division result.

#### More on `require`, `assert`, `revert`

`require`: The `require` statement is used to validate certain conditions before proceeding with the execution of a function. It takes a condition as the first argument and an optional error message as the second argument. If the condition evaluates to false, the execution of the function is immediately halted, and any changes made to the state are reverted. An error message can be provided to indicate the reason for the failure. The `require` statement is typically used for input validation and to ensure certain conditions are met before executing further code.

`assert`: The `assert` statement is used to check for conditions that should never evaluate to false. It is typically used to validate internal consistency or invariants of the contract. If the condition provided to `assert` evaluates to false, it signifies a critical error in the code, and the execution is halted. Unlike `require`, `assert` does not allow for recovery or error messages. The purpose of `assert` is to catch logical errors during development and testing.

`revert`: The `revert` statement is used to flag an error and revert the current transaction. It is often used when an unexpected or invalid state is encountered, and there is no safe way to proceed with the execution. The `revert` statement can optionally include an error message to provide more information about the error. When `revert` is triggered, all changes made to the state within the transaction are undone, and any Ether sent along with the transaction is returned. It is essential for preventing erroneous states and preserving the integrity of the contract.

In summary, `require` is used for input validation and conditional checks, `assert` is used for internal consistency and catching critical errors, and `revert` is used to flag and revert transactions when encountering unexpected or invalid states. Each statement serves a specific purpose in handling different types of errors and ensuring the integrity of the contract.

## Deployment

To deploy the `Module1` contract on the Ethereum network, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Solidity code using the Solidity compiler.

2. Choose your preferred deployment method (Remix, Truffle, etc.) and provide the necessary configuration details (e.g., network, gas limit, etc.).

3. Deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network by following the deployment process specific to your chosen deployment method.

4. Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the provided functions, including the `divide` function that showcases error handling.
